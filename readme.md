# hazelify-FreeContainers-1.0.2
Developed by hazelify as part of the JET / AE project. Designed to help fellow singleplayer gamers expand and customize containers in the game.

# Info
FreeContainers is an AE exclusive mod that allows any items to be stored in any containers in-game.

This version has been slightly altered for compatibility with 12.9.

By default, the [Aquamari](https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/Aquamari_water_bottle_with_filter) and [USEC MRE](https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/MRE_ration_pack) are filtered for the [S I C C pouch](https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/S_I_C_C_Organizational_pouch) to show users how to filter items by themselves.
